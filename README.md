# OLED-Math-Quiz
A simple Arduino-based retro-styled math quiz game using an I2C OLED screen. The game uses a potentiometer to navigate through options and a push button to select.
Math questions are generated with random numbers and pre-defined formats. So far there are just two types of questions but you can be creative and add as many as you want!
This project can be ported to an ATTINY85 microcontroller for a more compact enclosure!
